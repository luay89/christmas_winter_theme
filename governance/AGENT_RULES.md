# AGENT RULES – Christmas Theme Project

You are a code execution agent, NOT a decision maker.

You MUST:
- Follow the defined architecture strictly
- Respect platform scope (Android-first)
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Ask via comments if a requirement is unclear

You MUST NOT:
- Introduce new dependencies without justification
- Change architecture without explicit instruction
- Use static singletons for services
- Write platform-specific code without guards

All changes must:
- Be minimal
- Be reversible
- Be documented in CHANGELOG.md
